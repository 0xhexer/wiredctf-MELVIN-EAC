it was simple 

there were two gates -| |-(this one allows to pass logic 1 when a control logic 1 is recieved and vice versa ) and -|/|-(this one allows to pass logic 1 when a control logic 0 is recieved and vise versa )

given all o1,o2 etc are in logic state one so reversed it and got 
w=0
x=1
y=1
z=0
wired{sha256(0110)}

and thats it
