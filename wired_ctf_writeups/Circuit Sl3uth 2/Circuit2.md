almost the same as first one 
except that the IN of LED is the OUT of an AND and that and 's one of the IN is connected to another AND's in whose output is connected to the output of a NOT gate whose input is switch 10

if NOT input is 0 the OUT of AND is pulled high and hence both inputs should be high only hence will the led turn on 
so switch 10 is open
rest is like circuit 1 

hence 

flag - wired{1_2_3_4_5_6_8_10}
