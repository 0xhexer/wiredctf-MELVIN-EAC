i have done this in a not so intended way

was just getting a feel for what the challenge was 
but stumbled into a clue to flag 

first i looked into flag transform 
ok so there is some string to num swap done there 

then i did 
strings chall.pcapng -n 5
was scrolling through output when i saw a big para instead of a line 

found two sensible sentence in that para 

all hail king bluetooth , try some osnit or something 

searched google for all hail king bluetooth

first page was wiki with harold bluetooth title 

flag was the name harold bluetooth passed through flagtransform
